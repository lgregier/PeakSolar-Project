# PeakSolar Project - 
First release of Peak Solar_Solar Calculator prototype.
-- for client PeakSolar per instructions listed --
Attached are the Excel files for the SOLAR CALCULATOR and the INVESTMENT ILLUSTRATIONS.

The SOLAR CALCULATOR will be a stand-alone tool.  The sheet labeled "CALCULATOR" is what a user will see when they are on the web site.  They should be able to access just two areas, the drop-down menu to select their state, and the cell where they can key in their monthly electric bill.  The sheet labeled "DATA&FORMULAS" is just what it says.  This is where the math happens.  Each state gets an average amount of sunlight hours throughout the year and the cost of solar in any particular area is based almost entirely on the amount of sunlight hours.

The INVESTMENT ILLUSTRATION sheets are a little different.  First, there are two of them, a "Single Premium Illustration" and a "Flex Premium Illustration."  The difference is pretty simple.  If someone purchases $10,000 worth of solar panels with a single investment, that's a Single Premium Illustration.  If they choose to invest an amount monthly (say $250 a month for 10 years), that would be Flex Premium Illustration.

Ideally, we'd like to combine them so that someone visiting the web site could fill out their information, then click on either SINGLE PREMIUM or FLEX PREMIUM, and would then have the option to enter in either a one-time investment or a monthly investment.  (See the jpeg "INVESTMENT ILLUSTRATION INPUT" as this is basically what we'd like a user to see)

With both Investment Illustration Worksheets, the sheet labeled "CLIENT PRINTOUT" is basically what would be printed out for a potential client.  It prints out as 3 sheets.  You'll notice that the information input on the INPUT sheet is transferred to the CLIENT PRINTOUT sheet, and all of the calculations are done on the CALCULATIONS sheet.  Any change to the amount invested or the duration of the investment will alter the investment returns.

Play around with it to get a feel for how it works and what the formulas do.

We tried to streamline the formulas as much as possible, but the CALCULATIONS sheets are probably still a bit clunky.  If there's a more efficient way to get the same results, we're more than happy to use it.  If you have suggestions or any questions at all, please feel free to contact me.
